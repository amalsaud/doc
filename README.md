# Ninja's Stack

## Motivation

Ninja's Stack was developed during Coding Dojo Software Development Immersive Full-Time Bootcamp. 

Ninja's Stack is a website developed using the Python web framework Django. Frontend for Ninja's Stack was developed using the Bootstrap framework.

Our project covers all learned concepts: Restful Routing, Validations with Django, and Deployment.

## Description

Ninja's Stack is a community website for Ninja Developers; Ninja developers can ask and answer each other and comment on other Ninjas' replies.

## Features

- Manage Ninjas: Admins can add/delete Ninjas and update their information.
- Direct Message and Comments: Ninjas can start a chat and answer inquiries.
- Profile Edit: Each Ninja can edit his/her profile.

## Getting Started

### Installing Dependencies

#### Python 3

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

#### Virtual Enviornment

We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organaized. Instructions for setting up a virual enviornment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

#### PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by naviging to the `NinjaStack` directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages within the `requirements.txt` file.

### Running the project

#### Start the project locally

From within the `NinjaStack` directory, first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

To run the server, execute:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Then, for database migration, execute:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
```

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### Deployment
